# The-Quiet-Ones-
Project 3

#### To handle the pet adoption logic, we implemented the necessary functionality within the handleAdopt function. :

* `Local Storage:` The adopted pet's name is stored in the browser's local storage. This allows the data to persist even after the page is refreshed.
* `Validation:` It checks if the pet name is not empty or just spaces.
* `Alert:` It displays a success message to the user after adopting a pet.
* `Reset:` It resets the input field after successfully adopting a pet.
